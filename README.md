# Min-Max Heap Implementation in C++

## Description

This project implements a Min-Max Heap data structure in C++. The Min-Max Heap is a variation of the binary heap that allows both minimum and maximum elements to be accessed in constant time. This implementation is efficient and can be used in various applications where priority queue operations are required.

## Features

- Min-Max Heap implementation for efficient priority queue operations.
- Supports insertion, deletion, and access to both minimum and maximum elements.
- Modular design for easy integration into other C++ projects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/min-max-heap-cpp.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd min-max-heap-cpp
    ```

3. Include the Min-Max Heap header in your C++ project by adding the necessary header file.

## Usage

1. Integrate the Min-Max Heap by including the relevant header file in your C++ code:
    ```cpp
    #include "minmaxheap_chaurasia.hpp"
    ```

2. Utilize the Min-Max Heap functions in your project to perform priority queue operations efficiently.
